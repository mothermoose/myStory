Hello, my name is Dragon Drop. I am a dragon with special dropping powers. I drop Rubies down toward civilians, enabling them to have one special wish. 
When I get excited, sometimes diamonds come out of my tear ducts. These diamonds also fall on civilians, taking away their special powers. 
This makes me feel really sorry for the civilians, so I shoot out extra rubies to make up for it.
